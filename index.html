            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <p>
               Coppi's beloved, "The Woman in White" was Giulia Occhini,
               described by the French broadcaster Jean-Paul Ollivier as
               "strikingly beautiful with thick chestnut hair divided into
               enormous plaits". She was married to an army captain, Enrico
               Locatelli. Coppi was married to Bruna Ciampolini. Locatelli was a
               cycling fan. His wife wasn't but she joined him on 8 August 1948
               to see the Tre Valli Varesine race. Their car was caught beside
               Coppi's in a traffic jam. That evening Occhini went to Coppi's
               hotel and asked for a photograph. He wrote "With friendship to
               ...", asked her name and then added it. From then on the two
               spent more and more time together.
            </p>
            <p>
               Italy was a strait-laced country in which adultery was thought of
               poorly. In 1954, Luigi Boccaccini of La Stampa saw her waiting
               for Coppi at the end of a race in St-Moritz. She and Coppi hugged
               and La Stampa printed a picture in which she was described as la
               dama in bianco di Fausto Coppi—the "woman in white of Fausto
               Coppi".

            <h3>Death</h3>
            <p>
               In December 1959, the president of Burkina Faso, Maurice Yaméogo,
               invited Coppi, Raphaël Géminiani, Jacques Anquetil, Louison
               Bobet, Roger Hassenforder and Henry Anglade to ride against local
               riders and then go hunting. Géminiani remembered:
            </p>
            <p id="italic">
               "I slept in the same room as Coppi in a house infested by
               mosquitos. I'd got used to them but Coppi hadn't. Well, when I
               say we 'slept', that's an overstatement. It was like the safari
               had been brought forward several hours, except that for the
               moment we were hunting mosquitos. Coppi was swiping at them with
               a towel. Right then, of course, I had no clue of what the tragic
               consequences of that night would be. Ten times, twenty times, I
               told Fausto 'Do what I'm doing and get your head under the
               sheets; they can't bite you there'".
            </p>
            <p>
               Both caught malaria and fell ill when they got home. Géminiani
               said:
            </p>
            <p id="italic">
               "My temperature got to 41.6 °C ... I was delirious and I couldn't
               stop talking. I imagined or maybe saw people all round but I
               didn't recognise anyone. The doctor treated me for hepatitis,
               then for yellow fever, finally for typhoid".
            </p>
            <p>
               Géminiani was diagnosed as being infected with plasmodium
               falciparum, one of the more lethal strains of malaria. Géminiani
               recovered but Coppi died, his doctors convinced he had a
               bronchial complaint. La Gazzetta dello Sport, the Italian daily
               sports paper, published a Coppi supplement. The editor wrote that
               he prayed that God would soon send another Coppi.[29] Coppi was
               an atheist.[30]

            <h3>Legacy</h3>

            <p>
               The Giro remembers Coppi as it goes through the mountain stages.
               A mountain bonus, called the Cima Coppi, is awarded to the first
               rider who reaches the Giro's highest summit. In 1999, Coppi
               placed second in balloting for greatest Italian athlete of the
               20th century.
            </p>
            <p>
               Coppi's life story was depicted in the 1995 TV movie, Il Grande
               Fausto, written and directed by Alberto Sironi. Coppi was played
               by Sergio Castellitto and Giulia la 'Dama Bianca' (The Woman in
               White) was played by Ornella Muti.[35]
            </p>
            <p>
               A commonly repeated trope is that when Coppi was asked how to be
               a champion, his reply was: "Just ride. Just ride. Just ride."[36]
               An Italian Restaurant in Belfast, designed with road bike parts
               and pictures, is named Coppi. Asteroid 214820 Faustocoppi was
               named in his memory in December 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
               The village of his birth, previously known as 'Castellania', was
               renamed Castellania Coppi by the Piemont regional council in
               2019, in preparation for the centenary of his birth.[37]
